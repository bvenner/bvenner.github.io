Hello, My name is Nick Venner, I was born and raised in Colorado, and am a freshman at Metro State University ...

I am also a plantiff in the juliana v. US Lawsuit.

Known on social media as #youthvgov

<!--
  I'm a comment.
  A month ago I was filming this video for our school announcements and was interviewing them on the subject of climate change, only 2 out of 5 knew that climate change was connected to global warming, and one person knew about its connection to co2 emissions.

  Even though most of you know what climate change is I am still going to give a 10 second rundown.

  Well for starters climate change at its core can be boiled down into 3 points

  1. Burning fossil fuels emits co2 into the atmosphere.
  2. Increasing co2 concentrations cause a rise in global tempature.
  3. Increased global tempature wrecks havoc on the earths climate system.

  With this out of the way, we can talk about the lawsuit.

We filed our constitutional climate lawsuit, called Juliana versus United States, in the U.S. District Court of Oregon in 2015.

Our complaint asserts that, through the government's actions that cause climate change, it has violated the youngest generation’s constitutional rights to life, liberty, and property, as well as failed to protect essential public trust resources.



(***Read Exactly***)

Since we have had 4 years of delay and harm is continuing to occor, in the man time, we sought a court order preventing the federal government from issuing ** any** leases and mining permits for extracting coal on federal public lands, **any** leases for offshore oil and gas exploration and extraction, and **any** new federal permits for fossil fuel infrastructure.

To obtain the order, we filed what’s called a motion for a preliminary injunction while the Trump administration’s early appeal of our case is being heard.

On June 4th these issues were argued in front of the 9th Circuit in Portland, Oregon.  We are still awaiting a ruling.

In our lawsuit, youth are speaking up for the earth we share in common, for our air and for a livable climate.

            So what is this lawsuit saying should be held in trust
      
This concept of public spaces and resources like water being owned and shared by the public is not a new one; in fact, it is dates back over 2000 years to the times of Roman emperor, Justinian, and has been a part of English common law and our U.S. democracy for centuries. Under Roman law, the public’s right to use common resources like the waters and surrounding shores was paramount. “By the law of nature these things are common to mankind, the air, running water, the sea, and consequently the shores of the sea.” Under the Magna Carta in 1215, the British Crown was prohibited from transferring the valuable coastal fisheries to private lords because the seabeds belonged to the people. This is what we now call the Public Trust Doctrine.

This legal concept has taken hold worldwide, protecting resources for the public from beaches (below the ordinary high-water mark line) to navigable waterways and harbors, to wetlands and wildlife, to tributary streams and groundwater. And this idea of protecting public places for public uses, such as navigation, commerce, fishing, boating, swimming, and other recreational purposes, makes sense. In fact, the right of each person, as a member of the public, although shared with others, is inalienable, in the same way as each person is protected in their ownership and use of private property and right to breathe the air.
      
Our founding fathers, particularly Jefferson, said the earth is in trust and should not be degraded for future generations.
      


So why are we suing the government??

Because

The government has known about climate change and how devastating it would be for so long – since the 1960s at least

A report in 1965 (53 years ago), predicted catostrophic climate change and 10 feet of sea level rise this centry.

There are many, many actions that the government has taken (not just failed to take), that have violated our generation’s constitutional rights as well the public trust , like the air and our climate.

Instead, the government has promoted lots of fossil fuel mining and permitted use of our atmosphere as a dump.  And what is put up there lasts for centuries.

Our case has been blessed with the support of some outstanding scientists(Including James Hansen, and Joseph Stigletz), all of them working for free.  They have testified how urgent it is to stop fossil fuel emissions ASAP, because we have to bring CO2 levels to lower than what we’ve been talking about, to avoid climate extremes, droughts, and melting polar ice sheets.

We’ve already had 1 Celcius (that’s about 2.8 F) of heating since the industrial era.  Almost all of that to date has gone into the oceans, which ultimately transfer that to the atmosphere.  So we have 30 or 40 years of warming in the pipeline.  This means that we are out of carbon budget now.

The big news from the IPCC last year was that there is a giant difference between 1.5 Celcius of heating and 2 Celcius.  We can’t let it get to 2 C.  We have to stop putting carbon dioxide into our atmosphere now.

Our experts will also testify that the technology is available now to do this, and will result in a better future for all of us.  We have to get out there and make it happen.

The Climate emergency impacts everywhere, including Colorado. The potential impacts of climate change are vast, but to choose but one example.

How many of you are familiar with the Dustbowl?

A lot of people died.  Their animals died.  People’s businesses dried up.

People couldn’t breathe.  People simply had to leave, move away, and try to start a life somewhere else.

It might be suprising to know that we are in the process of creating drought conditions worse then the Dustbowl throughout the midwest.

This figure shows the devastation that climate change induced drought could cause if we stay on the business as usual path we are on now.

Seriously.  We are on a path where we have an over 80% chance of having worse than Dustbowl conditions statewide, lasting for over 30 years, between 2050 and 2100.  That’s our lives!  In our home state!  This is not okay.  We can turn this around, but we have to get out there and make it happen.

It’s not just affecting us.  This drought would stretch from the Midwest to California’s Central Valley, wiping out a lot of our food system.  Clearly we cannot afford to ruin our country and our food supply.

Now a natural response to this is what can I do about it? And my opinion about this can probably be summed up best in how I got involved in climate change activism.

I first learned about Climate Change when I was 8 years old, at the time I was involved in this enviormental club at my elementary school, and we had been focused on small order stuff, (encouraging recycling, plastic bags, the like.) And when I had tried to get the group to do some higher impact stuff. I got a lot of pushback from the school.

At the time this really shook me at the time. I remember thinking "Why? If they care so much about our futures, and understand the facts of climate change, then why arent they doing anything?"

When I was 11-12 I realized that the school district would never allow it.  The goal of encouraging individual actions is to help wash away the guilt that we all bear by living in this society.  Even if you could somehow convince everyone in the world to recycle, or to bring reusable bags to the grocery store, it would do essentialy nothing. The world would barrel ever further twards ecological devastation and we would all feel happy that we prevented it from being slightly worse.  Even though individual actions are certainly better then nothing, they are not going to solve the climate emergency. Climate change is inherently systemic, and requires collective action by everyone.

Now this systemic change can take many forms, from voting *solely* for the canditates that will have the most ambitious climate proposals. To talking and writing to representatives. To taking part in direct action, like the climate strike this Friday.

      So why not? Well… the reason is that there are some fundamental structural problems with how we run society that are getting in the way of being able to make headway on this problem. 
       
One, paradoxically, is democracy. Although we think that democracy – at least we in the democratic world think that democracy – is the fairest form of government, it has a fatal flaw which is that every few years the government goes back to the people and says “Will you vote us back in or not?” and that means that in order to win votes they need to please people in the here-and-now. So if a government is to say to the people “We’re going to do something that’s going to cause a great deal of economic pain, for the next ten years or twenty years” then they won’t be voted back in. And they know that. And so their hands are tied with what they are able to do. 
      
The second problem is capitalism. But it has a fatal flaw, which is that it doesn’t “cost” the future – it doesn’t look at the future and say “What is that future worth to me, right now?” So we can trade in concrete things – we can trade in oil, we can trade in gold, we can trade in crops – we can’t trade in our grandchildren’s futures. It’s really hard to put a price on that. 
      
And then finally, the problem is that what we need to do to stop carbon emissions is for every single human to take action – but this will only work if we all do it. It doesn’t make sense for one person or a few people to do it. And every human knows that. Everybody knows: “I could walk to work – it means that I’ going to get to work half an hour later, and I know it’s not going to make any difference unless eveybody’s walking to work, and I look around me and everyone else is driving, so I’m going to drive. I wish I didn’t have to but… what else can I do?” “I need to go to this conference. The only way to get there is to fly. Our aeroplanes all have carbon-emitting fuels. I wish they didn’t but they do – nobody’s done anything about that…” So the problem is that despite what we may think as individuals, we are trapped in this fact that unless everybody works together, individual action is pointless. 



<!--
*Calm confident we can do this.*
It’s also time for new voices.  It’s time for new thinking and new expectations, because A LOT is possible now.

(Keep hand raised for questions)

    1 How many people here know that the Platte River Power Authority has said they can go 100% renewable by 2030?  PRPA is publicly owned, not a Wall Street Company that would like to profit from and continue the old system for as long as possible. There’s a lesson in that!
*Pause*

    2 How many of you are in Xcel territory? (How many of you know where their electricity is from?  Did you know Colorado is the state that is 11th most dependent on coal?)

*Pause*

    3 Did you know if we didn’t have a monopoly in Xcel territory, and people could cities were allowed to enter contracts for the cheapest, cleanest, most reliable electricity,

We could have 89% clean electricity by the mid 2020s for one-third less than our energy with Xcel!  Instead of reinvesting faster, Xcel is taking over a half a billion in after-tax profits, that’s $400 from each household that they serve, out of Colorado, to their Wall Street investors every year.

Just imagine if communities could own that electrical generation and have that return for their communities.

One thing we can all do, is email boardofdirectors@xcelenergy.com every week


Write to them and remember to speak as a member of your community!  What groups are you a part of?  What communities are you from?  You can speak from those.  Be bold!  **Use your voice!  Be heard!**

This is the reason I like the OCT case so much, is that its one of the most promising forms of direct action out there. But I dont want to provide a false sense of security here.

This case isnt going to get a favorable ruling in the supreme court, and then have all the problems of climate change float away in the wind.

We still need the direct action of people arround the globe to solve this.

I would like to end by saying that even though climate change is a discouraging issue, its great to see the needle finaly start to move, you are seeing great proposals out of most democratic canditates for president, and seeing widespread concensus on the nececcity to do somthing

Anyway, thanks so much for your time, feel free to talk to me afterwards. Thanks for listing.  *END*
