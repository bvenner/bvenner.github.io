Hello, My name is Nick Venner, I was born and raised in the denver metro area, and am a senior at Bear creek high school...


as well I am also a plantiff in the juliana v. US Lawsuit.

Known on social media as #youthvgov


*Thursday:This is a version of a keynote talk that I am giving to some high school students, so I will be skipping some slides.   (mabye bctn anecdote.)*



I would like to begin with some questions?

---
# 1. Do you know what climate change is?
--

# 2. If so, are concerned about climate change?
--

# 3. If you are, do you know what you can do about it?
???
Ask Questions.
Well there are many potential things you can do, if you want to get started, but

Well for starters climate change at its core can be boiled down into 3 points

1. Burning fossil fuels emits co2 into the atmosphere.
2. Increasing co2 concentrations cause a rise in tempature.
3. Increased tempature wrecks havoc on the earths climate system.

With this basic primer out of the way, we can talk about the lawsuit.

We filed our constitutional climate lawsuit, called Juliana v. United States, against the U.S. government in the U.S. District Court of Oregon in 2015.

Our complaint asserts that, through the government's affirmative actions that cause climate change, it has violated the youngest generation’s constitutional rights to life, liberty, and property, as well as failed to protect essential public trust resources.

Throughout this lawsuit there have been many dramatic twists and turns (covering all of them would take upwards of 2 hours) but at the current point in time we are at this stage:

The case is currently at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which granted the trump administrations petition for permission to bring an interlocutory appeal. (A rare type of pre trial appeal.)

On February 8, 2019 we sought a court order preventing the federal government from issuing ** any** leases and mining permits for extracting coal on federal public lands, **any** leases for offshore oil and gas exploration and extraction activities, and **any** new federal approvals for fossil fuel infrastructure.

To obtain the order, we filed what’s called a motion for a preliminary injunction with the Ninth Circuit while the government’s early appeal of our case is being heard.

On June 4th these issues will be argued in front of the 9th Circuit.

In our case, youth are speaking up for the earth we share in common, for our air and for a livable climate.

Our founding fathers, particularly Jefferson, said the earth is in trust and should not be degraded for future generations.

So why are we suing the government??

Because

The government has known about climate change and how devastating it would be for so long – since the 1960s at least

A report in 1965 (54 years ago), predicted catostrophic climate change.

There are many, many actions that the government has taken (not just failed to take), that have violated our generation’s constitutional rights to life, liberty, and property, as well as failed to protect essential public trust resources, like the air and our climate.

Instead, the government has promoted and permitted lots of fossil fuel mining and allowed use of our atmosphere as a dump.  And what is put up there lasts for centuries.

Our case has been blessed with the support of some outstanding scientists, mostly working for free.  They have testified how urgent it is to stop fossil fuel emissions ASAP,

  because we have to bring CO2 levels to lower than what we’ve been talking about, to avoid climate extremes, droughts, and melting polar ice sheets.

We’ve already had 1 Celcius (that’s about 2.8 F) of heating since the industrial era.  Almost all of that to date has gone into the oceans, which ultimately transfer that to the atmosphere.  So we have 30 or 40 years of warming in the pipeline.  This means that we are out of carbon budget now.

The big news from the IPCC last fall was that there is a giant difference between 1.5 Celcius of heating and 2 Celcius.  We can’t let it get to 2 C.  We have to stop putting carbon dioxide into our atmosphere now.

Our experts will also testify that the technology is available now to do this, and will result in a better future for all of us.  We have to get out there and make it happen.

Lots of people have said that our case shouldnt be decided in the courts, and a big reason we cant afford to wait for the favorable winds of politics to fix this.

Climate Change is more important for our future in Colorado than I can possibly describe or say.  To just choose one aspect, since we have limited time

How many of you are familiar with the Dustbowl?

A lot of people died.  Their animals died.  People’s businesses dried up.

People couldn’t breathe.  People simply had to leave, move away, and try to start a life somewhere else.

Did you know we are on the path to recreating the Dustbowl this century, but worse?

This figure shows the devastation that climate change induced drought could cause if we stay on the business as usual path we are on now.

Seriously.  We are on a path where we have an over 80% chance of having worse than Dustbowl conditions statewide, lasting for over 30 years, between 2050 and 2100.  That’s our lives!  In our home state!  This is not okay.  We can turn this around, but we have to get out there and make it happen.

It’s not just affecting us.  This drought would stretch from the Midwest to California’s Central Valley, wiping out a lot of our food system.  Clearly we cannot afford to ruin our country and our food supply.

It’s also time for new voices.  It’s time for new thinking and new expectations, because A LOT is possible now.

    1 How many people here know that the Platte River Power Authority has said they can go 100% renewable by 2030?  PRPA is publicly owned, not a Wall Street Company that would like to profit from and continue the old system for as long as possible. There’s a lesson in that!

    2 How many of you are in Xcel territory? (How many of you don’t know where their electricity is from?  Did you know Colorado is the state that is 11th most dependent on coal?)

    3 Did you know if we didn’t have a monopoly in Xcel territory, and people could cities were allowed to enter contracts for the cheapest, cleanest, most reliable electricity,
We could have 89% clean electricity by the mid 2020s for one-third less than our energy with Xcel!  Instead of reinvesting faster, Xcel is taking over a half a billion in after-tax profits, that’s $400 from each household, out of Colorado, to their Wall Street investors every year.
Just imagine if communities could own that electrical generation and have that return for their communities.

One thing we can all do, is email boardofdirectors@xcelenergy.com every week


Write to them and remember to speak as “we”!  What groups are you a part of?  What communities are you from?  You can speak from those.  Be bold!  **Use your voice!  Be heard!**

There are a bunch of things that

    1 Turn our electricity systems around – get off fossil fuels fast.  Insist on this!

        a Talk to your local officials.

        b Have coffee with your city council people, or talk to them in that free 3 minutes before their meetings start.

        c Email the Xcel board of directors.

        d Email Gov. Polis, your reps and Senators – we expect a Green New Deal!  Email governorpolis@state.co.us

    2 Keep remaining fossil fuels in the ground.

    3 Stop buying, mining, and investing in what takes fossil fuels.  That’s money wasted, because it’s not going to be able to be used for its full life.

    4 If your family gets a new car, make sure it is electric, with a plug!

    5 New houses should be built with heat pumps instead of gas furnaces. That’s also healthier.  We can go to Zero Net Energy and ZNE Ready for new construction.  Let’s get our state legislature to pass this next year!  Get your local governments to do it!

    A Green New Deal is a big, bold transformation of the economy to tackle the twin crises of inequality and climate change. It would mobilize vast public resources to help us transition from an economy built on exploitation and fossil fuels to one driven by dignified work and clean energy.

    There are movements like sunrise, that have been presuring lawmakers from throughout the country to support the GND, and getting involved with them is a great way to acomplish change.

We get used to thinking things need to be or will continue as they are. There is a better future though, just around the corner.  We can have it, but we have to insist on it and make it happen.  Because some folks have an interest in keeping the old system going as it is.  Some technologies (like the combustion vehicles that have been dominant for 100 years) and the interest groups in power (like fossil fuels and the financial sector) are now out of date. It’s time for change and it can happen!

Did you know that where we stop emitting, that’s basically the temperature that we’ll have for millennia?  So much of what is being caused now is irreversible.  That’s why it is even more important for us to act.
We can do it!  And we can have the better world that is in store, if we change our current path.
Feel free to stay in touch!  I’m glad to work with you on your ideas and actions.  Please pass in the cards with any questions you have or anything you want to say. Thank you!  *END*
